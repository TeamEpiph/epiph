# Meteor accounts-entry

accounts-entry is a meteor package that relies on Iron Router and provides an alternative interface to accounts-ui, with whole pages for sign up and sign in.

**This fork is bumped to work with Meteor 1.2. This is a temporary solution until the authors of the plugin fix it.**


## Getting started

Clone The repository into a *packages/accounts-entry/* directory in your project. Run:

```
meteor add joshowens:accounts-entry-1.2
```

Then, follow the [original docs](https://github.com/Differential/accounts-entry).
